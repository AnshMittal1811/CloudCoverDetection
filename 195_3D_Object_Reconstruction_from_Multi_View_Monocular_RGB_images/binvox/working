1 you should run binvox and viewvox from the Terminal:
2 after downloading them into the same folder as your model, do:
3 chmod 755 binvox
4 chmod 755 viewvox
5 You can then run the programs like this:
  ./binvox
6 ./viewvox
  to get a summary of the commandline options.


7. Assume we have a 3D model like the one at the top left, in a file mug.wrl.

8. Run:
   ./binvox -d 32 -c mug.wrl
   which will create a file mug.binvox.
9. View the result with viewvox:
   ./viewvox mug.binvox
